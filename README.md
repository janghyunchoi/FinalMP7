Images must all be downloaded.

After downloading JavaFX and creating a project using github clone, you have to create a new project with JavaFx.
  1. go to File -> new -> project -> JavaFX Project (write down the name you want for your project)
  2. right click on the project you created -> new -> other -> application window in windowbuilder section (wrte down the name you want)
  3. from imported file, copy the code from MP7 and paste it on the JavaFX class you just created (Make sure to change all the class name      in the code to the name of class you created. You need to change only 4 times: public class, main, and public )
  4. from the file you imported, copy the file named "images"
  5. paste the file on src file.
  6. now you are good to play with our game!
